	Initial plant list was based on our survey, mostly of eastern part of Tidmarsh performed 
	from September 2011 to September 2017 as shown in a map here.
<!--	As of <a href="/static/tidmarsh/plantlist.html">March 2018</a>, the list contained  
	623 photographed species (including those planted);
	197 non-native--><!--(marked&nbsp;<span style="color:black">*</span>)--><!--, of which -->

	This list contains current data including adjacent Beaver Brook Conservation area.
	It uses newer plant classification with simplified hierarchy (as in MA County Checklist first edition).
	The list was generated using three tables: salicicola photos, explicit Tidmarsh records and generic records 
        from Tidmarsh bounding box which includes <a href="/photodb/tidmarsh/inaturalist/">verified observations</a> from iNaturalist.org 
	(e.g., <i>Cabomba caroliniana</i> misidentified as <i>Ranunculus aquatilis</i>, or <i>Barbarea vulgaris</i>). 
	Total, {{species_found|intcomma}} species with {{images_present|intcomma}} image- and {{explicit_records|intcomma}} other records
        are incorporated; it does not include records of yet not properly identified plants but includes
	photos of some "garden plants" (e.g., Betula nigra, Stewartia, Bistorta, Clematis terniflora, 
	at least the latter is an invasive plant and should be monitored or removed).
	The treatment of the invasive willow is here more detailed and includes records of putative hybrids.

<div class="summary"> 	
	The line below each plant species name shows metadata from County Checklist, including county distribution for the entire state. 
    	and when necessary additional notes.
	Every plant family and genus is anchored, i.e., for faster navigation one may append their name at the end of URL, e.g.,
        #Asteraceae, for Aster family.<br/>
