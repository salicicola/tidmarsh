TODO : In docker soft links would not work, hence to
replace photos/thums links to actual dirs and copy all needed files to data/static/thums and data/static/photos

COPY [^n]*    # All files that don't start with 'n'
COPY n[^o]*   # All files that start with 'n', but not 'no'
COPY no[^d]*  # All files that start with 'no', but not 'nod'
